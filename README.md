## Installation

...

## Usage

To create an instance of farmOS.js:

```js
import farmOS from 'farmos';

const host = 'https://farm.example.com';
const username = 'FarmerSteve';
const password = 'XXXXXXXXXXX';
const farm = farmos(host, username, password);
```

### Authentication

#### `.authenticate()`

```js
farm.authenticate()
  .then(token => localStorage.setItem('token', token));
```

### Logs

A log is any type of event that occurs on the farm, from a planting to a harvest
to just a general observation.

Here is an example of what one would look like as a JS object:

```js
const log = {
  id: '1',
  name: 'some log name',
  type: 'farm_observation',
  timestamp: '1519423702',
  done: '1',
  field_farm_notes: {
    value: '<p>some notes</p>\n',
    format: 'farm_format'
  },
}
```

Methods for getting, sending and deleting logs are namespaced on the `farm.log`
property.

#### `.get()`

Use the `.get()` method to retrieve a single log as a JavaScript object, or an
array of objects, which can be filtered:

```js
// Leave the parameter undefined to fetch all available logs
farm.log.get()
  .then(res => console.log(`Log #${res[0].id} is called ${res[0].name}`))

// Accepts a number for the id of the log you wish to fetch
farm.log.get(123)
  .then(res => console.log(`Log #123 is called ${res.name}`))

// Pass an options object to filter the results
farm.log.get({
  page: 2, // default === null
  type: 'farm_observation', // default === ''
}).then(res => console.log(`Log #${res[0].id} is called ${res[0].name}`))

```

The options object can have two properties: `page` is the page number in the
sequence of paginated results, starting from 0 and in batches of 100 logs;
`type` filters the results by log type.

The four default log types are:

- `farm_activity`
- `farm_harvest`
- `farm_input`
- `farm_observation`

Other log types may be provided by add-on modules in farmOS.

#### `.send()`

Send can be used to create a new log, or if the `id` property is included, to
update an existing log:

```js
farm.log.send(log, token)
  .then(res => console.log(`Log was assigned an id of ${res.id}`));
```

#### `.delete()`

__THIS METHOD HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED YET AND MAY NOT WORK__

```js
// For now, just an example of what it should look like eventually
farm.log.delete(123, token);
```

### Assets

Assets are any piece of property or durable good that belongs to the farm, such
as a piece of equipment, a specific crop, or an animal.

Here is an example of what one would look like as a JavaScript object:

```js
{
  id: '1',
  name: 'Brunhilde',
  type: 'animal',
  field_farm_animal_type: {
    id: '12',
    resource: 'taxonomy_term'
  },
  field_farm_description: {
    value: '<p>some notes</p>\n',
    format: 'farm_format'
  },
  archived: '0',
}
```

Methods for getting, sending and deleting assets are namespaced on the
`farm.asset` property.

#### `.get()`

Use the `.get()` method to retrieve a single asset as a JavaScript object, or an
array of asset objects, which can be filtered:

```js
// Leave the parameter undefined to fetch all available assets
farm.asset.get()
  .then(res => console.log(`Asset #${res[0].id} is called ${res[0].name}`))

// Accepts a number for the id of the assets you wish to fetch
farm.asset.get(123)
  .then(res => console.log(`Asset #123 is called ${res.name}`))

// Pass an options object to filter the results
farm.asset.get({
  page: 2, // default === null
  type: 'animal', // default === ''
  archived: true, // default === false
}).then(res => console.log(`Asset #${res[0].id} is called ${res[0].name}`))
```

The options object can have two properties: `page` is the page number in the
sequence of paginated results, starting from 0 and in batches of 100 assets;
`archived` is a boolean which determines whether to retrieve assets which the
user has chosen to archive; `type` filters the results by asset type.

Some common asset types include:

- `animal`
- `equipment`
- `planting`

Other asset types may be provided by add-on modules in farmOS.

#### `.send()`

Send can be used to create a new asset, or if the `id` property is included, to update an existing asset:

```js
farm.asset.send(asset, token)
  .then(res => console.log(`Asset was assigned an id of ${res.id}`));
```

#### `.delete()`

__THIS METHOD HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED YET AND MAY NOT WORK__

```js
// For now, just an example of what it should look like eventually
farm.asset.delete(123, token);
```

### Areas

An area is any well defined location that has been mapped in farmOS, such as a field, greenhouse, building, etc.

Here's an example of what an area looks like as a JavaScript object:

```js
{
  tid: '22',
  name: 'F1',
  description: '',
  ield_farm_area_type: 'greenhouse',
  field_farm_geofield: [
    {
      geom: 'POLYGON ((-75.53640916943549 42.54421203378203, -75.53607389330863 42.54421796218091, -75.53607121109961 42.54415472589722, -75.53640648722647 42.54414682135726, -75.53640916943549 42.54421203378203))',
    }
  ],
  vocabulary: {
    id: '2',
    resource: 'taxonomy_vocabulary'
  },
  parent: [
    {
      id: 11,
      resource: 'taxonomy_term'
    }
  ],
  weight: '0',
}
```

Methods for getting, sending and deleting areas are namespaced on the `farm.area` property.

#### `.get()`

Use the `.get()` method to retrieve a single area as a JavaScript object, or an array of objects, which can be filtered:

```js
// Leave the parameter undefined to fetch all available areas
farm.area.get()
  .then(res => console.log(`Area #${res[0].tid} is called ${res[0].name}`))

// Accepts a number for the tid of the area you wish to fetch
farm.area.get(123)
  .then(res => console.log(`Area #123 is called ${res.name}`))

// Pass an options object to filter the results
farm.area.get({
  page: 2, // default === null
  type: 'field', // default === ''
}).then(res => console.log(`Area #${res[0].tid} is called ${res[0].name}`))
```

__NOTE:__ Areas use a `tid` property, unlike logs and assets which have an `id`. This stands for taxonomy ID. In the future this may be changed to make it more consistent with the other entities.

The options object can have two properties: `page` is the page number in the sequence of paginated results, starting from 0 and in batches of 100 areas; `type` filters the results by area type.

Some common area types include:

- `field`
- `building`
- `property`
- `water`
- `other`

Other area types may be provided by add-on modules in farmOS.

#### `.send()`

Send can be used to create a new area, or if the `tid` property is included, to update an existing area:

```js
farm.area.send(area, token)
  .then(res => console.log(`Log was assigned an tid of ${res.tid}`));
```

#### `.delete()`

__THIS METHOD HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED YET AND MAY NOT WORK__

```js
// For now, just an example of what it should look like eventually
farm.area.delete(123, token);
```

### Farm & User Information

For requesting information about the farm, there is just one method, `.info()`, which is a getter.

#### `.info()`

```js
farm.info()
  .then(res => console.log(`The farm's name is ${res.name}`))
```
